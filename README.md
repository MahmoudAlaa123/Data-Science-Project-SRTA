# Data-Science-Project-SRTA

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing two datasets: advertising data and heart data. The purpose is to gain insights and perform various tasks on each dataset.

## Heart Data Analysis
For the heart dataset, the following steps were performed:

Data Acquisition: The heart data was obtained from a uci website.

Data Assessment: The acquired heart data was thoroughly examined to identify any missing values, or inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The heart data was explored using various statistical and visualization techniques. This process involved identifying relationships between different variables, uncovering patterns, and gaining a deeper understanding of the data.

Answering Questions: Based on the exploratory analysis, specific questions related to heart health were formulated and answered using the dataset. This step aimed to provide valuable insights into the factors associated with heart disease.



## Advertising Data Analysis
The analysis of the advertising dataset involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Numeric variables in the advertising dataset were standardized to ensure consistent scaling for the subsequent modeling phase. Standardization improves the performance and interpretability of the models.

Model Building: Three models were constructed using the advertising data: logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors. These models were chosen due to their effectiveness in classification tasks.

Model Evaluation: The three models were evaluated to determine their performance. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, were calculated to compare the models' effectiveness in predicting outcomes. The logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy, with 97%.
